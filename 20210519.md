<h3>Lean Product Development With SLOs</h3>
<p>

    Josh Armitage, DevOps Practitioner, Kubernetes Evangelist at Contino. How can you strip over-processing out of your value stream?, How can you understand and communicate what "good enough" looks like?, How can you systematically challenge and remove assumptions from your consumers?. In supporting enterprises in DevOps & agile transformations across three continents, I discovered a common theme, stories talk of what is to be enabled, but not how well it needs to perform. From this talk from Josh, you will learn how to adopt an SLO driven product development flow, from the mistakes we made along the way, tips and tricks for defining SLOs for low-frequency use cases and how to drive more impactful conversations
