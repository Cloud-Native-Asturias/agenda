<h3>From on-prem to SaaS: our (bumpy) journey to the Cloud</h3>

    As we’ve grown our business globally, the software solutions deployed in each region have become
    increasingly fragmented. Each project has made customisations to our product to meet customer
    requirements, which has slowed your rate of innovation and ability to deploy new features. 
    To resolve core issues like functioning with no common infrastructure, having to rewrite the 
    code and implement custom features for each customer, and deployment and production readiness
    taking a long time in every customer, we decided to move all the products to a common
    architecture that’s deployed on a common infrastructure.

<h3>Putting Chaos into Continuous Delivery - How to evaluate & increase the resilience of your applications</h3>
<p>
    <img align="right" width="150" alt="Jürgen Etzlstorfer" src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQHYlJHZc9kPXQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1535649645790?e=1620864000&v=beta&t=zDZ0OCOYZIjebWxRZ8q_MbeepNtrDfagyqndQZr29QE"/>
    Continuous Delivery practices have evolved significantly with the cloud-native paradigm. 
    GitOps & Chaos Engineering are at the forefront of this new CD approach, with an ever-increasing
    pattern involving Git-backed pipeline definitions that implement “chaos stages” in pre-prod
    environments to gauge service-level objective (SLO) compliance. In this talk,
    Juergen Etzlstorfer (maintainer of Keptn CNCF project) will discuss how you can construct
    pipelines that include chaos experimentation (using LitmusChaos) while simulating real-world
    load, and implement quality gates (based on SLOs) to ensure only resilient applications are
    deployed into production. He will also demonstrate how you can include chaos tests to your
    existing CD pipelines without the need of rewriting them.
