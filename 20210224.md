    K8ssandra is an open-source project that anyone in the community can use, improve, and enjoy. 
    K8ssandra is a cloud native distribution of Apache Cassandra® that runs on Kubernetes. 
    Accompanying Cassandra is a suite of tools to ease and automate operational tasks. This 
    includes metrics, data anti-entropy services, and backup/restore tools. As part of K8ssandra’s 
    installation process, all of these components are installed and wired together, freeing your 
    teams from having to perform the tedious plumbing of components.
