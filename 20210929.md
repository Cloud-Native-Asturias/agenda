    Daniel González Lopes, Site Reliability Engineer at k6.io. Observability gives developers the power to ask questions about their systems and get answers based on the existing telemetry they produce. During this talk, we'll start by introducing some core observability concepts/ideas to quickly jump into the why's and how's of the most common types of telemetry that your system can expose: Logs, Metrics, Traces, and Profiles.

<h3>Stranger Danger - how attackers can own your Kubernetes cluster</h3>
<p>
    <img align="right" width="150" alt="Matt Jarvis" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/startup-grind/image/upload/c_fill,dpr_2.0,f_auto,g_center,h_200,q_auto:good,w_200/v1/gcs/platform-data-cncf/events/Matt-Jarvis_JIz5HhV.jpeg"/>
    Matt Jarvis, Senior Developer Advocate at Snyk. Kubernetes is a powerful and highly configurable tool, but by default it's extremely insecure. In this live hacking session, I'll show how an attacker can expand the blast radius of an application exploit through to control of the entire cluster whilst demonstrating the misconfigurations which allow this to occur and showing how you can avoid these scenarios in the real world.
