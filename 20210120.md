<h3>Architectural Caching Patterns for Kubernetes</h3>
<p>
    <img align="right" width="150" alt="Rafal Leszko" src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E03AQEgN5RQhpSqug/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1603966926815?e=1616630400&v=beta&t=fQjX4PFJIF-WeKzTJ7rqeKEPHQcquMiQY98hAhzruCU"/>
    Kubernetes brings new ideas on how to organize the caching layer for your applications. 
    You can still use the old-but-good client-server topology, but now there is much more than that. 
    This session will start with the known distributed caching topologies: embedded, client-server, 
    and cloud. Then, I'll present Kubernetes-only caching strategies, including:
</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sidecar Caching</li>
        <li>Reverse Proxy Caching with Nginx</li>
        <li>Reverse Proxy Sidecar Caching with Hazelcast</li>
        <li>Envoy-level caching with Service Mesh</li>
    </ul>
<p>
    Integration Team Lead at Hazelcast, author of the book 
    "Continuous Delivery with Docker and Jenkins", trainer, and conference speaker. He specializes 
    in Java development, Cloud environments, and Continuous Delivery. Former employee in a number 
    of companies and scientific organizations: Google, CERN, AGH University, and more.
