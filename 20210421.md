<h3>Service Levels and Error Budgets</h3>

    100% is almost never the right reliability target for a service, and service level agreements (SLAs) aren't the right tool for SREs to manage a service. These two (apparent) heresies are fundamental to how Google SRE thinks about running large-scale distributed computing services: we set service level objectives (SLOs) expressing how reliable a service needs to be and manage our service to maximize product development and feature velocity within the agreed "error budget."
    We'll discuss the differences between indicators, objectives, and agreements; error budgets in practice; and how this brings product managers, product developers, and SREs together in a spirit of peaceful coexistence and cooperation.

<h3>From data to knowledge, observability in the world of the ephemeral and the distributed</h3>
<p>
    <img align="right" width="150" alt="Leonardo Murillo" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/startup-grind/image/upload/c_fill,dpr_2.0,f_auto,g_center,h_200,q_auto:good,w_200/v1/gcs/platform-data-cncf/events/0001-leo-murillo-retratos-estudio-2020-11_dNT5K3H.jpg"/>
    In order to achieve clear visibility into the behavior, operation and reliability of a cloud native solution, unique challenges must be overcome. The use of managed services and ephemeral resources, capable of scaling autonomously, pushes teams towards exploring novel strategies for data collection and consolidation. But observability goes beyond that - the purpose is to gain knowledge that enables organization to make strategic decisions by relating, analysing and extrapolating insights from raw telemetry data. In this talk we will explore solution instrumentation in cloud native environments, and we will go over recommendations on how to obtain the necessary context to go beyond monitoring, and gain knowledge and strategy from our system's telemetry.
