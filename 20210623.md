    Jose Manuel Redondo, PhD & Associate Professor. Docker is one of the most used software for containerizing applications nowadays. However, deploying an application in Docker requires fine-tuning the configuration to achieve effective isolation and avoid security problems. In this talk I show a way of doing that following tried and trusted security recommendations, so anybody can follow them to achieve a high-security level even starting with basic knowledge of Docker.
